        <h3><strong>Description</strong></h3>
        <p>This milkshake will burn off as many calories as you consume. You'll pump those triceps up grinding the ice cream down into a slurpable paste.</p>
        <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Vanilla Bean Ice Cream</li>
                <li>Non-Dairy Milk of your choice</li>
                <li>Chocolate Syrup</li>
                <li>Whipped Cream</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3><strong>Directions</strong></h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Start scooping that ice cream into the largest vessel you own. You're going to overestimate the ice cream:milk ratio. It should be 90:10</li>
                <li>Add the chocolate syrup. This is to taste. Live a little.</li>
                <li>Now slowly pour in your non-dairy milk. It will seem full immediately, but give it some time to percolate to the bottom.</li>
                <li>Before you dive right in to the mixing stage, remember Archimedes and his law of buoyancy. If you just hammer that spoon right in there, the overflowing mess will put a damper on the night. Gentle. Slow. Deliberate.</li>
                <li>You will soon realize that this concoction is simply to viscous to enjoy with a straw. So simply place the aforementioned straw into the recycling bin, and reappropriate your mixing spoon into a consumption spoon.</li>
                <li>Add whipped cream if you like, you're a grown man/woman who answers to no one.</li>
            </ol>
