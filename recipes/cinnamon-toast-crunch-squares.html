    <h3><strong>Description</strong></h3>
    <p>
        This recipe will lead you down a path from which there is no return. Forget what you thought you knew about snacking, get ahead of the game by stocking up on insulin, and preheat your God-damned oven.
    </p>
    <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mini Marshmallows</li>
            <li>Cinnamon Toast Crunch</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3><strong>Directions</strong></h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter and mini marshmallows together over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Slowly add Cinnamon Toast Crunch and mix gently, careful not to crush the squares into dust.</li>
            <li>In a cake pan lined with parchment paper, unload your mixture. Carefully level it out, and move to the fridge for thirty minutes to set. </li>
            <li>Remember to turn off the oven that you were so aggressively asked to preheat, despite no apparent call for it.</li>
        </ol>
