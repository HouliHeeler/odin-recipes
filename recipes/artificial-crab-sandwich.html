    <h3><strong>Description</strong></h3>
    <p>
        This sandwich will blow your head back, and at a fair price. You'll feel like a baller on a budget. People will look over at your meal and wonder how you could possibly afford that luxury in this disaster we call an economy. A gentleman never asks, a lady never tells.

    <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Artificial Crab Meat</li>
            <li>Miracle Whip</li>
            <li>Basil Pesto</li>
            <li>Green Onions</li>

        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3><strong>Directions</strong></h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a greased, cast-iron pan to medium heat. Add the artificial crab that you have selected. Cook 5-10 minutes until a healthy crab color.</li>
            <li>While the crab is reddening up, crack open your croissant, you can toast it or not, the choice is yours, but go ahead and toast it.</li>
            <li>Slather a dollop of Miracle Whip on that croissant. A dollop that makes you think "That may have been too much Miracle Whip".</li>
            <li>Next, you'll line that bad boy with basil pesto, spinach, and roughly chopped green onions, which are perhaps God's greatest invention.</li>
            <li>Dump that pan full of artificial crab meat into  the eager folds of the croissant. Close it up, and pack a fork. You'll start this bad boy by hand, but I promise you'll need the fork.</li>
        </ol>
